# 🐋 Hitchhiker's Guide to Cetaceans

Welcome, ocean friend! This is your friendly field guide to whales, dolphins, and porpoises.

Every week, we explore the latest research on cetacean behavior and biology—with photos, stories, and a **Scientific Geek Version** for those who want the deeper dive into methods and findings.

**AI engineer/researcher diving deep into cetacean communication and bioacoustics.**

By day, I build neural networks. By night, I study the ones inside whale brains. My focus is on **cetacean communication systems**—how whales and dolphins encode information, transmit culture, and navigate their acoustic worlds.

This blog is where machine learning meets marine biology. I break down the latest research in bioacoustics, analyze communication patterns with a signal processing lens, and explore what artificial intelligence can teach us about natural intelligence (and vice versa).

Think of it as marine mammal science written by someone who spends too much time thinking about spectrograms, convolutional networks, and whether GPT-4 could ever understand a sperm whale coda.
